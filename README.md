<h1>Code Samples</h1>

Here are a few more samples of my work.

<b>calculator.cpp</b>

A calculator that can parse moderately complex arithmetic expressions.
Users can also define and set variables within these calculations.

<b>MIPSsim.cpp</b>

Example of a MIPS dissassembler and processor simulator.
Given a set of binaries inside a text file the program will return a file containing the equivalent MIPS assembly instructions.
Also the program will return another file that contains a simulation of how these instructions would execute on a MIPS processor.
